# 👋 Hey there!

I'm a curious mind exploring the world of web development — currently building my foundation in **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

I love learning by doing and solving real-world problems through code. Right now, I’m diving deep into PHP — from loops and arrays to real-world applications — all while building up my skills one line at a time.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (So Far)
- 💻 PHP (core logic, forms, arrays, loops — leveling up daily)
- 🗃️ MySQL (soon diving into databases and data flow)
- 🌐 HTML & CSS (crafting clean, functional UI)
- 🔧 Git (version control + GitHub workflow)

---

## 🌙 About Me
- 🦉 Late-night coder — I thrive when the world sleeps
- 🤔 Problem-solver by nature, curious by default
- 🚗 I unwind with long solo drives and a blend of music, nature, and engine hum
- 🍺 2 cold beers, scenic views, and silence — my recipe for balance

---

## 💡 Currently Working On
- Mastering PHP through structured daily learning
- Building strong backend logic before diving into frameworks like Laravel
- Integrating databases and building practical mini-projects
