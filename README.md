# 👋 Hey there!

I'm a curious mind exploring the world of web development — currently building a solid foundation with **PHP**, **MySQL**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

Right now, I’m somewhere between the basics and building real stuff — writing code that sometimes breaks, learning why it did, and getting better with every bug fixed. Each line of code brings me a little closer to clarity, and I’m here for the journey.

## 🌙 A Bit About Me
- 🦉 Night owl — my best work happens when it’s quiet
- 🤔 Always exploring, always asking “what if?”
- 🍺 I recharge with peaceful drives, good music, and two cold beers
- 💻 Slowly but surely turning curiosity into code
